The idea is to run the sentences A and B from the SICK.txt corpus
through FreeLing, and use its tokenization to feed SynaxNet to obtain
the UD dependencies.  We generate a CONLL file with the SynaxNet
output, augmented with the lemmas and senses obtained from FreeLing.

We needed to disable FreeLing's MWE module.

To reproduce:

1. Download SICK.txt from here: http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/composes/sick.html

2. Install Freeling 4.0 from:

http://nlp.cs.upc.edu/freeling/

3. Install SyntaxNet from: 

https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/syntaxnet

4. Download the English UD pre-trained model from:

https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/syntaxnet/universal.md

5. Download the SUMO knowledge base from:

https://github.com/ontologyportal/sumo

6. Fix the paths in env.sh, process-freeling.py, and parse.sh to point to your
local installation paths.

Execute: run-all.sh

7. The relevant files are the [1-9]-{a,b}.conll and [1-9]*.txt; all
others can be removed if needed.
