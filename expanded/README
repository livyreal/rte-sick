This directory contains CONLL files for the sentences in columns 2 and
3 of the SICK.txt file.

It is separated by sentence size in the directory conllu/.

It uses the similar process (Freeling+SyntaxNet) as in ../pairs/.

This version uses Parsey McParseface: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/syntaxnet

To reproduce, execute run-all.sh.
