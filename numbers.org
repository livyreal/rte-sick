We have basically 7985 distinct sentences in SICK corpus. The corpus
has 10000 pairs of sentences, each pair has also the two original
sentences used to produce the pair. I am taking the 4 sentences of
each line to count the distinct sentences of the corpus.

#+RESULTS:
: 7985

Not all sentences finish with dot, @fcbr is fixing it before the analysis.
