This is a special version of the Python files in the root directory.
The idea is to process only the unique sentence values, instead of the
pairs.

Unique sentences come from the file ../numbers.sentences.

Execute run-all.sh, same caveats as given in ../README

This will process the senteces through SyntaxNet using the UD_English
pretrained model.

Next, to generate the CONLL with the output of SyntaxNet Parsey
McParseface, create a copy of sentences.conllu,
sentences-parsey.conllu with all fields empty, except id/form/lemma,
as follows:

(ql:quickload :cl-conllu)

(in-package :cl-conllu)

(let ((sents (read-conllu "sentences.conllu")))
  (dolist (s sents)
    (dolist (tk (sentence-tokens s))
      (mapc (lambda (x) (setf (slot-value tk x) "_")) '(upostag xpostag feats head deprel deps misc))))
  (write-conllu sents "sentences-parsey.conllu"))

Next, pipe the file through syntaxnet/demo-conll.sh --conll

Where demo-conll.sh is the same as demo.sh but without the last
command, that converts CONLL to ASCII trees.
