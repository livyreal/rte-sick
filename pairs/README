This directory contains aggregated information obtained by processing
all pairs from columns 2 and 3 from the SICK.txt corpus through
Freeling and SyntaxNet.  Next, we generate a txt file for each pair
containing the sentences, their entailment, their SUMO summary, and
the CONLLs.  Sentences are separated by entailment type.

pairs.AcBBcA - A contradicts B, B contradicts A
pairs.AcBBnA - A contradicts B, B neutral A
pairs.AeBBcA - A entails B, B contradicts A
pairs.AeBBeA - A entails B, B entails A
pairs.AeBBnA - A entails B, B neutral A
pairs.AnBBcA - A neutral B, B contradicts A
pairs.AnBBnA - A neutral B, B neutral A

To reproduce: run-all.sh

The relevant files are the [1-9]*-{a,b}.conll and [1-9]*.txt;
all others can be removed if needed.
